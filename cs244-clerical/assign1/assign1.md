Cyber-teammates and friends (<3)

Donovan Jasper: junior, CS + Music Dual Degree Canditate. 

Yasmine Mitchell: coterm, CS Systems + Computer and Network Security. 

Kelechi Uhegbu: Senior, Symbolic Systems (AI) + Computer Science (Computer and Network Security) coterm

### What is your team mascot?

### How will the team celebrate triumphs?

Boba from the best boba shop in the Bay (Sunright)
 
### How will the team make important decisions?

We will adopt a consensus (or at worst majority) decision process (see: RAFT distributed consensus protocol :P).

### How will the team resolve conflicts and discuss problems?

In the event of conflicts or issues, we will adopt a democratic approach to resolution, where the most popular decision will be the victor.
In terms of discussing problems, we all get along well and expect harmonious constructive collaboration.

### Leadership: What does “leadership” mean to your team?

In our team, leadership is not about authority but about setting an example and guiding the team towards our shared goals. A good leader, in our view, blends exemplary conduct with effective management to steer the team in the right direction.

### Who is the person that hits “submit” on your reports and milestones? The one who crosses the “t”s and dots the “i”s? You can assign different people to be in charge of different reports and milestones, but it helps to have a clear person in charge for each one.

Donovan will submit each report and milestone.  The responsibility of dotting t's and crossing i's will be given to the most knowledgeable person in regards to that assignment.

### What are the skills of the team members? What special skill does everyone bring to the team?

Yasmine: Boba expertise, experience implementing distributed systems

Donovan: Boba consumption, willpower, pizzazz, network security

Kelechi: Boba willingness, active listening, networking middleware

### When will the team meet as a group each week? Please be precise.

We will begin by meeting twice a week to start. From this meeting twice a week, we will adjust as necceasry.
Our initial meetings will be 2, 2-hour sessions from 3:30 - 5:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays at Roble Hall's conference room.

### What will be the procedure for missing or being late to this meeting? How much advance notice must be given and using what method? (We recommend that last-minute text messaging is not used to inform team members that a member will be late or miss a meeting.)

We trust in our strong rapport to make this not a major concern.  We will provide advance notice in the case of missing or tardy as soon as we know of the conflict.
(and apology boba is always nice :P) 

### How will you design your software so people can work independently, through stable and well-defined interfaces?

We will try and choose a project that's inherently modular. When we first start the project and interfaces are more in flux, we will meet more often/have more constant communication.

### What area(s) of networking research will you explore?
Distributed Systems 😎

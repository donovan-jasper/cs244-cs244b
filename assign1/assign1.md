### Who are your team members?

### What is your team mascot?

Wombat? :0 - def open too discussion

### How will the team celebrate triumphs?

Sunright? (lol Yasmine will likely remove the '?')

### How will the team make important decisions?

I'm pretty flexible so I'm happy to contribute to this or not, generally I think a consensus descision process would be reasonable for a group of this size.

### How will the team resolve conflicts and discuss problems?

We get along, likely best idea wins?  I think we can take a democratic resolution approach.

### Leadership: What does “leadership” mean to your team?

A leader isn't a boss, but leads by example.  This I think is a well held opinion, but a good leader doesn't shy away from management to reach their direction? idk 

### Who is the person that hits “submit” on your reports and milestones? The one who crosses the “t”s and dots the “i”s? You can assign different people to be in charge of different reports and milestones, but it helps to have a clear person in charge for each one.

I'm happy to submit and help out with some of the clerical stuff.  Happy to proof read a bit too but this should likely go to he/she who feels most confident about that section of code who isn't the author.

### What are the skills of the team members? What special skill does everyone bring to the team?



### When will the team meet as a group each week? Please be precise.



### What will be the procedure for missing or being late to this meeting? How much advance notice must be given and using what method? (We recommend that last-minute text messaging is not used to inform team members that a member will be late or miss a meeting.)



### How will you design your software so people can work independently, through stable and well-defined interfaces?



### What area(s) of networking research will you explore?

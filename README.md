cs244b:
~~By Monday, April 15 you must form a project team of 1-4 people and sign up for a slot to meet with the course staff (details coming soon).~~

~~Before Monday, April 22 you should schedule a meeting of your team with the course staff to discuss your proposed project. Once your proposal has been approved, submit through Gradescope a short (1 paragraph) description of what you want to do, which may be posted on the web site so everybody knows what the different projects are. Please also include a short description of CS244B related content if your project is shared with another class.~~

Friday, May 31 you must submit through Gradescope a project progress report with a final title and list of project team members, including a link to the git repository for your source code and a one paragraph abstract of your project (which can be the same as your proposal, but things may have changed).

By Friday, June 7 you must submit through Gradescope a paper describing and evaluating your project that is no more than 6 pages in at least 11-point font. Papers and git repositories will be published on the class web site.

Saturday June 8 you will present your project to the class and demo what you have done in a mini one-day conference. The conference will include our registrar-assigned exam time (8:30am-11:30am), but continue later. We can schedule around you if you canâ€™t be there for the whole day. We will serve dinner.

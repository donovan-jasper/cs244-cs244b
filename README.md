cs244b:

By Friday, June 7 you must submit through Gradescope a paper describing and evaluating your project that is no more than 6 pages in at least 11-point font. Papers and git repositories will be published on the class web site.

Saturday June 8 you will present your project to the class and demo what you have done in a mini one-day conference. The conference will include our registrar-assigned exam time (8:30am-11:30am), but continue later. We can schedule around you if you canâ€™t be there for the whole day. We will serve dinner.
